# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset containing patient health parameters and builds a model that can assist healthcare professionals or users in identifying potential heart disease risks early.

# Features

- Predicts whether a person has heart disease or not.
- Uses various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)..
- Trained on a publicly available dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset).
- Visualization of data and model evaluation metrics.

# Dataset

The dataset used is the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, which includes the following features:

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0–3)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia (0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect)
- `target`: 0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease
